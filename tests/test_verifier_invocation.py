"""The shipped verifiers must not trust the directory the agent controls.

Harbor starts tests/test.sh in the image WORKDIR (/app in every template
task) — the directory the agent has been writing to all episode. The
`python3 -m` launcher puts that cwd first on sys.path, so an agent that left
a /app/pathlib.py (or json.py, csv.py, ...) behind would have its module
imported by the suite in place of the stdlib and could forge a passing run.
bun has the same class of problem: it loads bunfig.toml — including
[test].preload, which executes arbitrary scripts inside the test process —
from its cwd. These tests pin every shipped test.sh to the hardened
invocation, because the hello-world examples are the lines every author
copies.
